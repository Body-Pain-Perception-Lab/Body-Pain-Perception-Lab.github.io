How does the brain turn raw sensory input into something as deeply personal and complex as pain?

At the Body Pain Perception Lab, we study how the brain constructs pain. Pain isn’t just a direct response to injury; it’s shaped by expectations, past experiences, and the way our nervous system interprets signals from the body. Sometimes, this interpretation defies intuition, as seen in "pain illusions," where the subjective experience of pain doesn’t align with the harmless nature of the stimulus. Our goal is to unravel these phenomena, from their biological foundations to their psychological impact.

We are an international and interdisciplinary team of researchers with backgrounds in cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, physiotherapy, and medicine. We combine psychophysics, neuroimaging (MRI, EEG, MEG) and computational modeling to investigate how the brain and spinal cord generate, amplify, and sometimes distort pain. Our research includes both healthy individuals and people living with chronic pain, helping us uncover fundamental mechanisms while also seeking insights that could improve pain assessment and management.  

We are based at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN) and the Danish Pain Research Center (DPRC) at Aarhus University in Denmark.
