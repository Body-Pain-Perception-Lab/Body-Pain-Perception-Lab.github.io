Why does a gentle touch sometimes feel painful? Why can an injury hurt more — or less — depending on what we expect? And how does the brain turn raw sensory input into something as personal and complex as pain?  

At the Body Pain Perception Lab, we study how the brain constructs pain. Pain isn’t just a direct response to injury; it’s shaped by expectations, past experiences, and the way our nervous system interprets signals from the body. Sometimes, this interpretation is counterintuitve, like in the case of paradoxical sensations or so called "illusions" of pain. Our goal is to understand these phenomena, from their biological underpinnings to their psychological impact.  

We are an international and interdisciplinary team of researchers with backgrounds in cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, physiotherapy, and medicine. By combining neuroimaging (MRI, EEG, MEG), psychophysics, and computational modeling, we investigate how the brain and spinal cord generate, amplify, and sometimes distort pain. Our research includes both healthy individuals and people living with chronic pain, helping us uncover fundamental mechanisms while also seeking insights that could improve pain management.  

We are based at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN) and the Danish Pain Research Center (DPRC) at Aarhus University in Denmark.
