How does the brain turn raw sensory input into something as deeply personal and complex as pain?

At the Body Pain Perception Lab, we study how the brain constructs pain, from its biological foundations to its psychological impact.

<!-- Pain isn’t just a direct response to injury; it’s shaped by expectations, past experiences, and the way our nervous system interprets signals from the body. Sometimes, this interpretation defies intuition, as seen in "pain illusions," where the subjective experience of pain doesn’t align with the harmless nature of the stimulus. Our goal is to unravel these phenomena. -->

We are an international and interdisciplinary team of researchers with backgrounds in cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, physiotherapy, and medicine. Using psychophysics, neuroimaging (MRI, EEG, MEG) and computational modeling, we investigate how the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) generate, amplify, and sometimes distort pain. Our research spans both healthy individuals and those living with chronic pain conditions, allowing us to uncover fundamental mechanisms while also seeking insights that could improve pain assessment and management.  

The lab is based at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience [(CFIN)](https://cfin.au.dk/) and the Danish Pain Research Center [(DPRC)](https://clin.au.dk/dprc) at the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University in Denmark.
