## Latest News  

Welcome to the news section! Here, we share updates, publications, and exciting developments from our lab.  

### 2025  

<!-- *16 Mar*: Today marks the last official day of Anastasia’s lab rotation! As an NAD-PhD fellow, she has been a fantastic addition to our team. We’ve truly enjoyed working with you over the past few months and look forward to staying in touch as you continue your rotations in other labs throughout the year! <br> -->

<!-- *Mar*: 🎙️ Francesca appears on the Science podcast to discuss how the brain constructs the experience of pain! Tune in [here] to hear an engaging breakdown of our key findings, recently published in Science Advances <br>.-->

<!-- *12 Mar*: 🔥 New "hot" paper published in Science Advances: “Thermosensory predictive coding underpins an illusion of pain” A huge thank you to everyone involved, as this was a massive team effort! [Check it out here](/publication/2025-03-12-tgi-uncertainty). <br> -->

*6 Mar*: 📰 We’re gearing up to release some exciting new science! Things are bubbling under the surface, and we can’t wait to share our findings with you soon. Stay tuned! <br>

*3 Mar*: 📢 Alex submits a poster abstract to NeuPSIG on paradoxical heat across the lifespan. If this topic interests you, let’s meet in Berlin this fall! <br>

*28 Feb*: 🚀 Our brilliant collaborator, Ashley, has just released her latest preprint on the effects of noradrenergic blockade on interoception and metacognition. Truly fantastic work! [Check it out here](/publication/2025-02-28-na-intero) <br>

*17 Feb*: 🏆 Thank you, Lundbeck Foundation, for another grant! This time, we’ll be organizing a Computational Pain Conference in Aarhus, scheduled for October 2025. Stay tuned for more details soon! <br>

*14 Feb*: 📝 Jesper submits a conference abstract to CCN—8 pages packed with cutting-edge computational modeling! If you’re heading to CCN in Amsterdam this year, make sure to catch him! <br>

*13 Feb*: 📄 Camilla and Francesca submitted a paper today! After years of work, it feels great to finally send this off. Fingers crossed! <br>

*1 Feb*: 📖  Camila’s latest paper is featured in the February issue of The Journal of Pain! [Check it out here](/publication/2025-02-27-threshold-tgi) <br>

*21 Jan*: 🤝 We had the pleasure of hosting Julia Stache from Karolinska Institutet to discuss our ongoing collaboration on core body temperature perception, inflammation, and sickness. Special thanks to her supervisor, Julie Lasselin, who joined us online to share more about their research! <br>

*9 Jan*: 👋 Welcome, Anastasia! She’s an NAD-PhD fellow who chose our lab for her first rotation, eager to learn about magnetoencephalography (MEG). We’re excited to help her get started! <br>

*6 Jan*: 🎉 Welcome back, Rebecca! She first joined us as an intern in 2021 during her bachelor’s in Psychology at Potsdam University (Germany). After completing her master’s at Lund University (Sweden), she’s now back as a full-time Research Assistant on our Lundbeck-funded project on pain and language. We’re thrilled to have her on board! <br>

*1 Jan*: 🎂 The BPP Lab celebrates four years of top-notch pain science! And Kora is officially starting her PhD today! <br>

### 2024

*19 Dec*: 🌍 Francesca and Micah visit UC Davis! It was great to catch up with former UCL fellow Erie Boorman and discuss decision-making neuroscience. Always inspiring to reconnect with brilliant minds! <br>

*5 Dec*: 🧠 We had a fantastic time hosting Waci Adamczyk from Lübeck University. He visited us in Aarhus to talk about the spatial aspects of pain perception. The discussions were both engaging and thought-provoking, and we look forward to continuing the conversation with future collaborations! <br>

*28 Nov*: 🎤 Francesca presents at the Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain, Aalborg University! She had the pleasure of presenting our work on the thermal grill illusion at the Translational Neurobiology of the Pain System XXIX seminar. A huge thank you to Thomas and Kristian for the invitation and for leading an exciting discussion on what “pain modulation” means. Plus, great chats on science and life in Denmark and beyond! <br>

*19 Nov*: 👁 The BPP Lab had the pleasure of attending a talk by Ole Jensen, visiting from Oxford University. A fantastic example of how to do proper cognitive neuroscience! <br>

*15 Oct*: 🔍 Phenomenology meets cognitive neuroscience! We were thrilled to host Peter Stilwell and Anthony Fernandez from Odense University for an eye-opening presentation on phenomenology. Their ideas challenged us (in the best way possible!) and resonated deeply with our own work, just from a different perspective! <br>

*1 Oct*: 🎉 Welcome, Arthur! Today, he officially starts his postdoc in the BPP Lab, but truth be told, he’s been one of us for a long time already. Excited for this next chapter! <br>

*9 Sep*: 📊 Arthur and Jesper at the Stan Conference in Oxford! <br>

*3 Sep*: 📢 Exciting discussions on interoception and active inference as Ryan Smith gives a talk at CFIN. Always great to engage with cutting-edge research! Thanks to the ECG lab for inviting him! <br>

*20 Aug*: 🧗 We were lucky to have Ben de Haas stop by CFIN during his family holiday near Aarhus. He gave us another fantastic talk on vision science — always a treat! And in the spirit of tradition, some of us went climbing afterward. Fun fact: Ben introduced Francesca and Micah to climbing back in their London days at the Castle Climbing Centre! <br>

*12 Aug*: 🧳 Camilla’s research visit begins at the Nocion Lab at Université Catholique de Louvain (Belgium). We wish her a fantastic research visit and look forward to hearing about her experiences! <br>

*5 Aug*: 🌍 This week, the BPP Lab is attending the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Conference! It's always a pleasure to reconnect with colleagues, meet new collaborators, and engage in exciting discussions about pain science! <br>

*17 Jul*: 🎤 Francesca and Micah visit San Camillo Hospital in Venice Lido to present their latest research! An inspiring exchange of ideas in a stunning setting. Thank you to our hosts for welcoming us. We hope to return for a longer visit (preferably when it’s a bit cooler!)

*1 Jul*: 😊 Francesca and Micah are at Padova University reconnecting with former colleagues. Revisiting familiar places with new insights made for a rewarding and nostalgic experience!

*25 Jun*: 🧠 The ECG and BPP labs are at FENS in Vienna this week! An incredible opportunity to engage with high-quality neuroscience research. It was also a pleasure to attend the FENS Kavli Network event!
