## Abstract
The Bayesian brain hypothesis, as formalized by the free-energy principle, is ascendant in cognitive science. But, how does the Bayesian brain obtain prior beliefs? Veissi√®re and colleagues argue that sociocultural interaction is one important source. We offer a complementary model in which ‚Äúinteroceptive self-inference‚Äù guides the estimation of expected uncertainty both in ourselves and in our social conspecifics.
