## Abstract
Sensory systems utilise stimulus-driven attention to survey the environment for significant features. The question arises: are the cortical networks that influence stimulus-driven attention supramodal or specific to each sensory modality? Here we employed a hierarchical target detection task (n=30), examining cortical responses linked to the detection of salient targets in the somatosensory and auditory modality. In a temporal decoding analysis, we reveal a transient early supramodal process activated by target detection. We also demonstrate that both common and unique modulations of salience-related cortical responses to somatosensory and auditory targets involve modality-specific and frontal regions using Parametric Empirical Bayes. Specifically, we found that the inferior frontal gyri share information across both sensory modalities, while recurrent information transfer between ipsilateral inferior frontal gyri and associative regions was modality-specific. Finally, we showed both supramodal and modality-specific attentional modulations of effective connectivity linking regions across hierarchical levels in the cortex. Our results provide evidence for an attention network which integrates information across inferior frontal cortices to detect salient targets irrespective of their specific sensory modality. Beyond the notion of a supramodal attention system, our findings support the role of modality-specific cortices in processing inputs from other sensory modalities, highlighting that attention can bias these processes at multiple stages of the cortical hierarchy.
