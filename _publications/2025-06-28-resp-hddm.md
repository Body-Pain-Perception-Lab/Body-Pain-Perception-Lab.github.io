## Abstract
Respiratory rhythms play a critical role not only in homeostatic survival, but also in modulating other non-interoceptive perceptual and affective processes. Recent evidence from both human and rodent models indicates that neural and behavioural oscillations are influenced by respiratory state as breathing cycles from inspiration to expiration. To explore the mechanisms behind these effects, we carried out a psychophysical experiment where 41 participants categorised dot motion and facial emotion stimuli in a standardised discrimination task. When comparing behaviour across respiratory states, we found that inspiration accelerated responses in both domains. We applied a hierarchical evidence accumulation model to determine which aspects of the latent decision process best explained this acceleration. Computational modelling showed that inspiration reduced evidential decision boundaries, such that participants prioritised speed over accuracy in the motion task. In contrast, inspiration shifted the starting point of affective evidence accumulation, inducing a bias towards categorising facial expressions as more positive. These findings provide a novel computational account of how respiratory rhythms modulate distinct aspects of perceptual and affective decision-dynamics.
