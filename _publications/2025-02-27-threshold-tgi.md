## Abstract

In the Thermal Grill Illusion (TGI), the spatial alternation of non-noxious warm and cool temperatures elicits burning sensations that resemble the presence of noxious stimuli. Previous research has largely relied on the use of specific temperature values (i.e., 20 ¬∞C and 40 ¬∞C) to study this phenomenon in both healthy individuals and patient populations. However, this methodology fails to account for inter-individual differences in thermal sensitivity, limiting the precision with which TGI responses can be evaluated across diverse populations. To address this gap, we created a Two-Dimensional Thermal Grill Calibration (2D-TGC) protocol, enabling an efficient and precise estimation of the combinations of warm and cool temperatures needed to elicit burning sensations tailored to each individual. By applying the 2D-TGC protocol in 43 healthy participants, we demonstrated that the TGI can be thresholded using an adaptive psychophysical method, and that multiple combinations of warm and cool temperatures can elicit this phenomenon. More specifically, the protocol facilitated the identification of temperature combinations that elicit TGI with varying levels of probability, intensity, and perceived quality ranging from freezing cold to burning hot. Finally, our results indicate that TGI responsivity can be quantified as a continuous variable, moving beyond the conventional classification of individuals as responders vs. non-responders based on arbitrary temperature values in the innocuous temperature range. The 2D-TGC offers a comprehensive approach to investigate the TGI across populations with altered thermal sensitivity, and can be integrated with other methods (e.g., neuroimaging) to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for perceptual illusions in the thermo-nociceptive system.
