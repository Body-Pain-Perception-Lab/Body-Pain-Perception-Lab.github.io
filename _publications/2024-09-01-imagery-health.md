## Abstract
Variations in mental imagery ability has been linked to various emotional, cognitive and personality measures.
However, a comprehensive theoretical framework is missing to account for these associations and their link to
mental health. Here, we present evidence for a model of mental imagery centered around a putative "inwardly
focused" cognitive style, which integrates a range of traits associated with visual imagery. By examining the
association between self-reported imagery vividness and a diverse array of cognitive and personality questionnaire
measures, we demonstrate that imagery is significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness and mindful
presence, as well as the personality traits of openness, conscientiousness and extraversion. Canonical correlation
analyses revealed that we could link these measures to a singular latent variable, which we propose reflects a
latent inward trait or "inwardly focused" cognitive style. Canonical variates were stable across two datasets (n=298
and n = 293). In addition, the latent inward trait was negatively correlated with alexithymia (the inability to
identify and express emotions) and positively correlated with the frequency of involuntary autobiographical
memories. To further examine these relationships, we constructed a latent measure of negative mental health using
depression, stress and neuroticism items. A path analysis revealed that the latent inward trait mediated the effects
between imagery vividness and negative mental health via alexithymia and involuntary autobiographical
memories, suggesting that the latent inward trait plays a crucial role in shaping how mental imagery impacts
mental health, notably as it intersects with other important individual cognitive differences.
