## Bio and research interests

Alex has a background in cognitive neuroscience and completed her PhD in Psychology at the University of St. Andrews (United Kingdom). Her postdoctoral research explores temperature and pain perception using both behavioural approaches and advanced fMRI and revolves around applying novel methods and statistical approaches to improve our fundamental understanding of thermosensation. She is currently applying a population receptive field mapping approach to investigate how temperature is represented in the human brain, as well as focusing on understanding the presence of abarrent thermal perception, such as paradoxical heat sensation, in healthy and patient populations.
