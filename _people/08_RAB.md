## Bio and research interests

Rebecca is a Research Assistant who recently completed her Master’s in Psychology at Lund University (Sweden). Before pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in psychology, she worked as a trained nurse specializing in pediatric anaesthesia, giving her a unique perspective on pain from both clinical and scientific standpoints. Her research interests span clinical psychology, phenomenology, and the application of large language models in understanding human experiences.

She is currently using large language models to better characterize the lived experiences of chronic pain, with the goal of improving how pain is understood and assessed.
