We actively collaborate with leading researchers to advance our understanding of pain and temperature perception in both acute and chronic conditions. Our work also extends to other perceptual and cognitive processes, including interoception (i.e., the ability to perceive bodily signals from visceral organs) and metacognition (i.e., insight into how we perceive, interpret, and make decisions).

Our ongoing collaborations are with:

**Micah Allen** & the Embodied Computation Group, Aarhus University (Denmark)

**Sif Gylfadottir**, Aarhus University (Denmark)

**Fernando Exposto**, Aarhus University (Denmark)

**Ben de Haas**, Giessen University (Germany)

**Julie Lasselin**, Karolinska Institute (Sweden)
