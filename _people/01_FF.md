Francesca is an Associate Professor in Pain Neuroscience at the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University. She trained as a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Padova (Italy), Aarhus University (Denmark), and University College London (United Kingdom). In 2021, she established her lab at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience at Aarhus University, thanks to a European Research Council Starting Grant. Her current research is also funded by the Lundbeck Foundation through an Experiment grant.

Her main scientific interests lie in understanding the biological and psychological principles that shape our experience of pain, with implications for chronic pain research as well as broader theories of perception and consciousness. Beyond the lab, she has a deep appreciation for movement and embodiment, having trained as a dancer for over a decade. These days, she enjoys traveling, hiking, and yoga, when not fully immersed in scientific discourse.
